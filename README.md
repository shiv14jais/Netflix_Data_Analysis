# Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Dataset
In this mini project, we will perform an exploratory data analysis on a Netflix dataset to investigate trends in movie lengths over the years. Our primary focus will be to determine if there has been a change in the trend of movie durations.

We will categorize the movies into two groups based on their duration:

- Short Movies: Duration <= 60 minutes
- Long Movies: Duration > 60 minutes

Our analysis will examine whether the number of short movies has increased compared to long movies over the years based on their release year.

# Files: 
netflix_data.csv : Contains the data for movies released from 1940 - 2021 

notebook.pynb : Contains the python script for analysis. 


# To Run: 
- Download all three files in the repository.
- Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook.  (Comments have been added to most of the lines to help understand the code)
- Run all.
